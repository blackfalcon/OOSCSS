#OOSCSS
This project's goal is to illustrate the incompleteness of the OOCSS project whereas CSS is NOT an object orentated language. 

While many of the principals in OOCSS are sound and have brought best practices to a chaotic language, the core concept that `classes` are `objects` has created much confustion.  

##From Wikipedia
###Object-oriented programming (OOP) 
is a programming paradigm using "objects" - data structures consisting of data fields and methods together with their interactions - to design applications and computer programs. Programming techniques may include features such as data abstraction, encapsulation, messaging, modularity, polymorphism, and inheritance. Many modern programming languages now support OOP, at least as an option.

###CSS
[is] a style sheet language, or style language, is a computer language that expresses the presentation of structured documents. One attractive feature of structured documents is that the content can be reused in many contexts and presented in various ways. Different style sheets can be attached to the logical structure to produce different presentations.

###Sass
Sass is a Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) metalanguage. It is a scripting language that is interpreted into CSS. SassScript is the scripting language itself. ...

... Sass (in the larger context of both syntaxes) extends CSS by providing several mechanisms available in more traditional programming languages, particularly object-oriented languages, but that are not available to CSS3 itself.

##Is SCSS OOP?
No, but in today's world, if you really want to talk about OOCSS, this is as close as you are going to get.
